# falling sand simulation
- a hobby project in making an interective falling sand simulation

## installation
- clone the repository
- run ´´´make´´´ to build or ´´´make test´´´ to build and immediately run

### usage
- run the executable

#### status
- only the basic structure of the program is implemented, with no sand.

##### roadmap
- implement a simulation containing sand particles that are drawn to the screen
- simulate gravity and interactions for the particles
- make the simulation interactive
- change colours of batches of sand particles / individual sand particles
- increase complexity of interactions
- increase detail of simulation
- increase performance
